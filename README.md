# Digital-Twin-for-MyCobot-Pro-600
This project analyzes the forward kinematics of the MyCobot Pro 600, developing a kinematic model and digital twin in MATLAB. The model is imported into ROS and Rviz for simulation, and the end-effector positions are compared between the actual robot and the simulation.
