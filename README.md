In this project, I first derived the homogeneous transformation matrices for the MyCobot Pro 600 robot. 

1. Downloaded the robot's STL files and assembled the parts in SolidWorks.
2. Assigned the coordinate systems and created an assembly file.
3. Exported the assembly as an XML file using Simscape Multibody Link.
4. Imported the XML file into MATLAB and added slider blocks to the joints in Simulink to control the joints and simulate the robot's motion.
